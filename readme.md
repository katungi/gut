# GUT - Good Dev Env for JS

Things we still need to do:

- Create a bundle and js wrapper for deploying to npm
- Create a CLI that basically takes in input and outputs a file
- Do better FS stuff
- Create HMR using Web-Sockets
- Create a way to run tests
- Good ESBUILD configs
- Full Typescript support and type safety
